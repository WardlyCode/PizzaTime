# PizzaTime

Hey Guys!!!

This is honestly for myself, but here is some info if someone finds themselves here :).

The Dominos API Python Wrapper I used for this script was created by --> https://github.com/Magicjarvis !!!
Please checkout the repo here --> https://github.com/Magicjarvis/pizzapi
He has some great documentation on how it works! 

This simple script will order you a small ultimate pepperoni pizza and a 20oz bottle of Coke from your local Dominos!

To use this script - 
  Make sure you are using python3, 
  install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt, 
  fill out the variables in the beginning of the PizzaTime.py script,
  and Run the Script!! Bam!! Pizza Time!
